# PinguyOS-Remix
PinguyOS recreated from Ubuntu Gnome with shell scripts

## Why?
This idea come to me due to the stalled development of [PinguyOS](http://pinguyos.com "Linux distro by Antoni Norman") and his [wish to stop](http://forum.pinguyos.com/Thread-Thinking-of-killing-off-Pinguy-OS "Thinking of killing PinguyOS thread") its development.

## The idea
The result would be to build something like the solution I posted at [the PinguyOS forum](http://forum.pinguyos.com/Thread-Thinking-of-killing-off-Pinguy-OS?pid=35147#pid35147) based on Erik Dubois' [Ultimate Linux receipts](https://github.com/erikdubois/Ultimate-Linux-Mint-18.1-Cinnamon) and with some info Antoni supplied [here](http://forum.pinguyos.com/Thread-PinguyOS-METAPACKAGE?pid=34132#pid34132) and [here](http://forum.pinguyos.com/Thread-PinguyOS-14-04-4-1-Pinguy-Builder-Update?pid=34833#pid34833).

The interface could use as a base the [MacBuntu](http://www.noobslab.com/2016/04/macbuntu-1604-transformation-pack-for.html) design and the [Plank](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Plank) dock (also [this](https://github.com/deepsidhu1313/plank_multi-dock_on_multi-display_solution) and [this](http://www.webupd8.org/2016/03/lightweight-dock-plank-0110-released.html)) instead of the heavier Docky.

The base for working a new version of PinguyOS should be [Ubuntu Gnome Remix](https://ubuntugnome.org/) instead of the one Antoni used, Xubuntu. I think with this the task of building PinguyOS would be simpler hence it is based on Gnome Shell and Ubuntu.

## The ISO
After having this in place I think that using [PinguyBuilder](http://pinguyos.com/2015/09/pinguy-builder-an-app-to-backupremix-buntu/) to make the official ISO would be easier and this would allow us all to try to help this move forward.

## Help :)
If someone with better knowledge wishes to do this too lets talk.
